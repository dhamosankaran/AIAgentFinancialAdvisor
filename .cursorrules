# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g., version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools

* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, pandas
* **Data Sources**: Alpha Vantage API
* **Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx
* **Documentation**: Markdown, Swagger/OpenAPI

# Lessons

* **API Keys**: Always use environment variables for API keys. Never commit API keys.
* **Virtual Environment**: Always activate the virtual environment before running commands.
* **Financial Data**: Cache API responses to avoid rate limits and improve performance.
* **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling for all API calls and data processing.
* **Testing**: Write basic tests, especially for financial calculations.
* **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.
* **Data Validation**: Validate all user inputs and API responses.

* **Security**: Follow basic security practices.
* **Logging**: Implement basic logging for debugging.
* **Performance**: Optimize basic performance.
* **Maintainability**: Follow clean code principles.
* **GIT SECURITY CRITICAL**: When API keys are accidentally committed to git history, use git filter-branch or create clean orphan branches and force push to completely remove sensitive data from GitHub. Always enhance .gitignore to prevent future exposures.
* **EMERGENCY API KEY PROCEDURES**: If API keys are exposed in git history: 1) Immediately revoke the exposed key, 2) Create new API key, 3) Use git filter-branch or orphan branch approach to completely rewrite git history, 4) Force push to replace remote history, 5) Clear local reflog and run aggressive garbage collection, 6) Enhance .gitignore with comprehensive exclusions.

# Implementation Success
✅ **FAP INTEGRATION WITH MY PROFILE TAB COMPLETED**
The Financial Analysis Pipeline functionality has been successfully moved from a separate FAP tab to the My Profile tab, creating a streamlined user workflow. Users can now update their profile and immediately run FAP analysis using the latest profile data, which automatically generates and stores portfolio allocation that syncs across all tabs (Dashboard, My Portfolio, Markets). The implementation includes proper portfolio summary generation, fixed API endpoints, and comprehensive cross-tab data synchronization.

# Lessons Learned - Updated Entry
* **FAP Integration with My Profile Tab**: Successfully moved Financial Analysis Pipeline functionality from separate FAP tab to My Profile tab for streamlined user workflow. Users can now update their profile and immediately generate new portfolio allocation that automatically syncs across all tabs (Dashboard, My Portfolio, Markets). Enhanced runFapAnalysisFromProfile function to save allocation to profile_portfolio.json and trigger cross-tab refresh for consistent data display.
* **Profile Portfolio Save Endpoint Fix**: Fixed critical issue where the save endpoint required three fields (user_profile, portfolio_allocation, portfolio_summary) but frontend was only sending two. Updated frontend to generate comprehensive portfolio summary including profile details, market outlook, and allocation recommendations with proper formatting.
* **Cross-Tab Data Synchronization**: Implemented robust data synchronization where profile changes in My Profile tab automatically update stored portfolio data and reflect across Dashboard (Portfolio Allocation section), My Portfolio (Investment Proposal section), and Markets tabs for consistent user experience.
* **API Endpoint Testing**: Thoroughly tested all profile portfolio endpoints with proper JSON payloads. Confirmed save endpoint returns structured response with id, timestamp, user_profile, portfolio_allocation, portfolio_summary, risk_profile, total_allocation, asset_classes, and last_updated fields.
* **Streamlined User Experience**: Eliminated need for separate FAP tab by integrating functionality directly into My Profile tab. Users now have single location for profile management and portfolio generation, reducing complexity and improving workflow efficiency.
* **Profile Update Data Flow Fix**: Fixed critical issue in profile update endpoint where CoordinatorAgent was using stale profile data. Added user_profile_service.save_profile(profile) before generating allocation to ensure coordinator uses latest profile data. This resolved discrepancy where profile updates weren't immediately reflected in allocation generation (e.g., aggressive profile showing moderate allocation). Now all risk profiles generate correct allocations: Conservative (25% stocks, 45% bonds), Moderate (50% stocks, 25% bonds), Aggressive (65% stocks, 15% bonds).

# Next Steps
1. Test complete frontend workflow in browser - [X] COMPLETED ✅
2. Verify cross-tab synchronization works correctly - [X] COMPLETED ✅
3. Test profile updates trigger allocation changes - [X] COMPLETED ✅
4. Document the implementation for future reference - [X] COMPLETED ✅
5. Update memory with successful implementation details - [X] COMPLETED ✅

# Final Status
✅ **ALL FAP INTEGRATION TASKS COMPLETED AND TESTED**
- Fixed profile portfolio save endpoint with portfolio_summary field ✅
- Enhanced frontend to generate comprehensive portfolio summary ✅
- Fixed profile update endpoint data flow issue (save profile before allocation generation) ✅
- API endpoints working correctly (200 OK responses) ✅
- Profile portfolio storage and retrieval fully functional ✅
- End-to-end testing successful for all risk profiles:
  * Conservative: 25% stocks, 45% bonds ✅
  * Moderate: 50% stocks, 25% bonds ✅
  * Aggressive: 65% stocks, 15% bonds ✅
- Cross-tab synchronization working correctly ✅
- Frontend and backend integration complete ✅
